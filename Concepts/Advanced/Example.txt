A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Necessity is the mother of invention
A picture is worth a thousand words
Beggars can’t be choosers
All that glitters is not gold
Blood is thicker than water
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Curiosity killed the cat
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
It is better to give than to receive
